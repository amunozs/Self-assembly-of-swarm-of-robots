<h2>Self-Assembly of a swarm of robots</h2>
<b>Álvaro Muñoz Serrano</b>
</table>
<p>
A self-assembly algorithm for a swarm of robots. The user must introduce an image with the desired zone in black and a swarm of
n robots will assembly in this form. The robots used are inspired on the kilobots, so they only comunicate with the neighbors
whithin a range transmiting data and calculating the module of the distance between them (not the direction).
